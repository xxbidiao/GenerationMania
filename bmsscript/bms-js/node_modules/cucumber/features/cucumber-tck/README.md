# Cucumber Technology Compatibility Kit

## Implementation-independent Cucumber features

This is the collection of features that are expected to run successfully against any Cucumber implementation.

## Running with Aruba and Cucumber 1.0

This project contains Ruby step definitions that can be used to run all the features with [Aruba](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba) and Cucumber 1.0 (ruby). The main reason for running with Aruba is that this can generate documentaion/examples from the features. See Aruba's documentation on reports for details.

## Running with your own (bootstrapped) Cucumber implementation

Once you manage to get the core.feature running you should be able to start running the other features as well...
